# MHWI-Single-Quest-Auto-Spliter

AutoSplitter script for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne by Aldanari<br>
This is an edited version for single quest run of the [full game script](https://github.com/MoonBunnie/Monster-Hunter-World-Iceborne-AutoSplitter) by MoonBunnie, JalBagel and GreenSpeed<br>
Inspired by Lyuha's [Auto Splitter](https://github.com/lyuha/MHW-split)<br>
And added adresses found on [HunterPie](https://github.com/HunterPie/HunterPie/blob/main/HunterPie/Address/MonsterHunterWorld.421631.map) github<br><br>
You have to reset the time manualy after completing a quest.<br>
Curently does not support spliting for multiple monster quest.<br>
(if you know how or where to find the memory adresses to make that work please tell me :)
